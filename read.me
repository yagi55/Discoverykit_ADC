- This is my sample code of 3ch ADCs functions for B-L072Z-LRWAN1 LoRa®/Sigfox™ Discovery kit.
- In each timer interruption of TIM2, ADC functions are worked and get 256 value in each channel. 
- ADC data are transferred by DMA function.
- Using adc0(PIN1 of CN6), adc4(PIN3 of CN6) and adc5(PIN7 of CN3) for ADC channels.
[Problem]
- Single channel A/D conversion feature seems to be no problem but it always affects other ADC channels value. 
  For example, only 1v analog input is loaded in adc0, it always affects adc4 and adc5 output value in some extent.
  Each adc pin configured pulled down.
